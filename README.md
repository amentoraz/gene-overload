gene-overload
=============



Intro
-----

Gene Overload was a Massive Multiplayer Online game that stayed online in the years 2011-2012. It was heavily based in science, specifically in the Genetic Algorithms branch of Artificial Intelligence.

In the game you managed a few "warriors", which would be randomly generated and which could attack, defend, heal, use specific abilities, and several other options, depending on conditions checked out by their randomly generated decission tree.

You could also evolve new generations of warriors, testing them against each other. The ones which scored best would have a higher chance to breed, and you could set parameters like the mutation rate, the amount of genders (1-3), and some other stuff.

The game isn't complex to play, but it goes really deep and it became frustrating for many players, since they couldn't understand what their decissions really influenced at all, since they would just "indirectly" control their warriors.




ToDo
----

After the game was offline, I thought it'd be a good idea to open its source code and try to make it better. There's a lot of work into it, specially when it comes to the Genetic Algorithms hardcore parts.

Currently an html/ folder is provided. This is the whole game except the content manager (which has some problematic property rights) which isn't necessary anyway to make it work.

My ideas for the future would be:

- Writing some script with which to create the basic database, which is currently nowhere to be found.

- Making it a standalone game that you can install and play locally.

- Data mining the old data I have locally in order to to draw conclussions on the best tactics to train a GA algorithm like this.
